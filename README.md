This repository showcases a subtle Python bug involving a ZeroDivisionError. The error is not immediately apparent due to a conditional statement that attempts to handle the case where division by zero is possible. However, the error still occurs when the specific condition is met. This example highlights the importance of thorough testing and careful consideration of edge cases when writing Python code.
